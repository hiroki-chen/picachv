//! This module defines the context for the policy enforcement.
//!
//! Contexts are used in the evaluation of the expression, operator, and the enforcement of the policy.
//! It is of course possible to pass multiple arguments to a function but this is not ergonomic in the
//! sense that function signature change breaks the code. Instead, we can wrap all the arguments in a
//! context and pass the context to the function.
